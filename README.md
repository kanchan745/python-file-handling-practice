# python-file-handling-practice
Today I revised and practiced basic file handling concepts in Python.


Topics Covered
- Reading a file using read()
- Writing data into a file
- Deleting a file using os module
- Understanding modules and pip

This practice helped me to understand how files are handled in real applications.
